## ⚡ The 20,000+ TPS Vision
The BNB Chain 2026 Tech Roadmap targets **20,000+ TPS** and **sub-second finality**. However, standard privacy protocols (like Tornado Cash forks) process complex, gas-heavy cryptographic proofs one transaction at a time. This clogs the network, spikes gas fees, and physically prevents the chain from scaling. 

**Aegis-Oxbow solves this at the infrastructure level.** Instead of forcing the blockchain to process 100 separate privacy transfers, Aegis-Oxbow utilizes an off-chain AI Relayer to pool user intents. It batches these intents and submits them to the network as a single **Super-Transaction**. 

By compressing blockspace usage by up to 90%, Aegis-Oxbow multiplies effective TPS and slashes individual gas costs, providing the exact middleware needed for BNB's next generation of scaling.

## 🧠 Key Innovations
1. **Intent-Based Batching:** Users sign an "intent" to move funds anonymously. The protocol bundles these intents, acting as an ultra-efficient "Privacy Bus" rather than 100 separate Ubers.
2. **Local AI Gas Predictor (`brain.js`):** The Relayer runs a deterministic, local neural network that analyzes block-by-block base fees. It predicts the optimal millisecond to execute the batch, securing the absolute cheapest blockspace without relying on paid external APIs.
3. **Account Abstraction (Paymaster):** The AI Relayer sponsors the gas for the final execution, ensuring the user's fresh destination wallet remains completely disconnected from the source wallet.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Deployment)

Aegis-Oxbow is fully Dockerized for immediate evaluation.

### Prerequisites

* Docker & Docker Compose
* Node.js v18+ (if running manually)
* Foundry (for contract testing)

### Run the Full Stack

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ramprasad4121/Aegis-Oxbow.git
cd Aegis-Oxbow
```

2. **Environment Setup:**
Copy the example environment files and add your BSC Testnet private keys.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. **Launch via Docker:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

* The Next.js frontend will be live at `http://localhost:3000`
* The AI Relayer API will be live at `http://localhost:4000`
