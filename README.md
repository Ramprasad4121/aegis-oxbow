##  The 20,000+ TPS Vision
The BNB Chain 2026 Tech Roadmap targets **20,000+ TPS** and **sub-second finality**. However, standard privacy protocols (like Tornado Cash forks) process complex, gas-heavy cryptographic proofs one transaction at a time. This clogs the network, spikes gas fees, and physically prevents the chain from scaling. 

##  Why This Matters for Everyday Users
Standard crypto infrastructure is public by default and expensive to obfuscate. Aegis-Oxbow abstracts these complexities away for the normal user:

* **The "Coffee Shop" Privacy Problem:** If you buy a coffee with crypto today, the barista can view your entire transaction history and net worth. Aegis-Oxbow lets users easily fund a fresh, disconnected "spending wallet" to protect their financial privacy in everyday life.
* **The "Uber Pool" of Gas Fees:** Existing privacy tools require users to pay massive individual gas fees. By batching up to 100 intents into a single transaction, our AI Relayer splits the network fee, reducing the cost of privacy to fractions of a penny.
* **Zero Technical Knowledge Required:** Normal users don't want to manage cryptographic withdrawal notes or manually calculate gas limits. With our UI, they simply enter an amount, paste a destination address, and click "Deposit." The AI agent handles the rest.

**Aegis-Oxbow solves this at the infrastructure level.** Instead of forcing the blockchain to process 100 separate privacy transfers, Aegis-Oxbow utilizes an off-chain AI Relayer to pool user intents. It batches these intents and submits them to the network as a single **Super-Transaction**. 

By compressing blockspace usage by up to 90%, Aegis-Oxbow multiplies effective TPS and slashes individual gas costs, providing the exact middleware needed for BNB's next generation of scaling.

##  Key Innovations
1. **Intent-Based Batching:** Users sign an "intent" to move funds anonymously. The protocol bundles these intents, acting as an ultra-efficient "Privacy Bus" rather than 100 separate Ubers.
2. **Local AI Gas Predictor (`brain.js`):** The Relayer runs a deterministic, local neural network that analyzes block-by-block base fees. It predicts the optimal millisecond to execute the batch, securing the absolute cheapest blockspace without relying on paid external APIs.
3. **Account Abstraction (Paymaster):** The AI Relayer sponsors the gas for the final execution, ensuring the user's fresh destination wallet remains completely disconnected from the source wallet.

* Node.js v18+ (if running manually)
* Foundry (for contract testing)

### Run the Full Stack

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ramprasad4121/Aegis-Oxbow.git
cd Aegis-Oxbow
```

2. **Environment Setup:**
Copy the example environment files and add your BSC Testnet private keys.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. **Launch via Docker:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
